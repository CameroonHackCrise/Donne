Open-source blood donation platform.

Project by IEEE SCU SB 


# Introduction :

Blood donation is a serious global issue, and blood is needed everyday for patients and people injured in accidents. Unfortunately, the rate of blood donation is very low around the world that it barely over 3% .

We decided to change this and we developed a platform where blood donation could be revolutionized around the world.. 
We created Donné.

The app was named after Alfred Donné, the discoverer of blood platelets 

# What is Donné ?

Donné is an online, peer-to-peer blood donation platform that allows blood donation to happen without the need of searching the internet for blood donors, also an app which test your eligibility to donate blood, make a blood donation schedule and a wiki section to raise blood donation awareness.


# How Donné works ?

- You register in our platform as a donor then you are available to anyone who need blood.
- People who need blood will search by country and blood type.
- They will use the contact methods you provided to contact you and make an appointment with you to donate.
- Voila! You saved a live.
