# Donné

Open-source blood donation platform, formely known as NeedBlood.

Project supported by **IEEE SCU SB** , Current Version : 2.0 , **Playstore release SOON!!**

# Introduction :

Blood donation is a serious global issue, and blood is needed everyday for patients and people injured in accidents. Unfortunately, the rate of blood donation is very low around the world that it barely over 3% .

We decided to change this and we developed a platform where blood donation could be revolutionized around the world.. 
We created Donné.

Donné,It's the name of Alfred François Donné, the discoverer of leukemia and blood platelets, the name of the platform was chosen to honor him.

Also, Donné is the past of the verb donner in French, meaning to give, and an adjective, meaning achievable or affordable, pointing to our goal of providing a social network for blood donors.


# What is Donné ?

Donné is the social network of blood donors, instead of sharing photos and posts we share our blood to the ones who need it.

Donné was built by users, for users, it's easy to use and gets the job done with the least number of steps possible.  

Donné is an online, peer-to-peer blood donation platform that allows blood donation to happen without the need of searching the internet for blood donors, also an app which test your eligibility to donate blood, make a blood donation schedule and a wiki section to raise blood donation awareness.


# How Donné works ?

- You register in our platform as a donor then you are available to anyone who need blood.
- People who need blood will send requests by city and blood type.
- Corresponding people will receive notitifcations with required blood and contact data.
- Relax and wait for someone to contact you.
- Voila! You saved a live.

# Platform Goal

Our goal is to mainly decrease the number of posts on social media requesting blood and only getting interactions with little or no donors at all to save people, moving them to a platform that one can hopefully find a donor quickly. Also to spread awareness about blood donation around the country.


# How do I benefit from Donné ?

NeedBlood will help you to join the community of blood donors and help making our world a better place to live in. Also it will benefit you in person; your blood donation schedule will be organized and automated, blood donation is very important for general health, it helps to renew blood and body on regular basis.
